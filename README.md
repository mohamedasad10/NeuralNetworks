# Neural Networks Mini-Project - CSC312 Assignment 3

I implemented a neural network in Python to handle a classification task using datasets like noisy moons and blobs. The project included tasks such as forward propagation, cost function calculation, backpropagation, and optimization techniques. I also explored issues like overfitting and underfitting, as well as multi-class classification. The goal was to design and test the neural network using various datasets to understand how different parameters affect the performance of the model."
