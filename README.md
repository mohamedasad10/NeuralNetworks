# Neural Networks Mini-Project - CSC312 Assignment 3

## Introduction
**Neural Networks** in **CSC312: Machine Learning**. This is a **Neural Networks** mini-project for the **CSC312: Machine Learning** course. In this project, I implemented a neural network, gaining hands-on experience with building and training models. I applied theoretical concepts taught in class to practical coding challenges, testing my understanding of neural networks, model training, and the ability to implement algorithms effectively.
